JQuery code for a random pictures collection with  fade effects. 

Please, don't forget to put a link with the JQuery source 
ex.: <script type="text/JavaScript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

Define a width and a height for your pictures because there is a bug with Google Chrome
